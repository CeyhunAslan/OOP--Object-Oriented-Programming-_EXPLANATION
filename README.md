# OOP--Object-Oriented-Programming-_EXPLANATION
I explained and demonstrated object-oriented programming with examples.

## Class
In object-oriented programming, a class is an extensible program-code-template for creating objects, providing initial values for state 
(member variables) and implementations of behavior.

## Constructor
In class-based object-oriented programming, a constructor (abbreviation: ctor) is a special type of subroutine called to create an object.
It prepares the new object for use, often accepting arguments that the constructor uses to set required member variables.

## Static Class
A static class in C# is a class that cannot be instantiated. A static class can only contain static data members including static methods, 
static constructors, and static properties. In C#, a static class is a class that cannot be instantiated.

## Encapsulation
In object-oriented programming (OOP), encapsulation refers to the bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data, or the 
restricting of direct access to some of an object's components

## Inheritance
Inheritance is the procedure in which one class inherits the attributes and methods of another class. The class whose properties and 
methods are inherited is known as the Parent class.

## Interface 
An interface is a programming structure/syntax that allows the computer to enforce certain properties on an object (class).

## Abstract
Its main goal is to handle complexity by hiding unnecessary details from the user. That enables the user to implement more 
complex logic on top of the provided abstraction without understanding or even thinking about all the hidden complexity.
